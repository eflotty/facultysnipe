1. Fill in columns A-G
2. Set enabled to FALSE
3. Leave scraper_class blank initially
4. Notify developer to build scraper
5. After testing, change enabled to TRUE

miami_microbio | Miami - Microbiology | MiamiMicrobiologyScraper | https://med.miami.edu/... | TRUE | static | rep@company.com | | | Production

EXAMPLE ROW (In Development):
stanford_bio | Stanford - Biology | | https://biology.stanford.edu/people | FALSE | static | rep@company.com | | | Needs scraper
